# H5P EXAMPLE

This project provides a minimal setup to work with React in Vite, including Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules to maintain code quality.

## Features

- React: Library for building user interfaces.
- Vite: Fast and simple build tool.
- ESLint: Tool to identify and report patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.
- H5P-Standalone: Library for creating interactive web content.

## Requirements

Before starting, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

## Installation

To install the project dependencies, open a terminal at the root of the project and run:

`npm install`

## Execution

To start the local development server, execute:

`npm run dev`

This will start the Vite server, and you can access the project at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

To build the project for production, run:

`npm run build`

This will generate a `dist` folder with statically optimized files for production.
